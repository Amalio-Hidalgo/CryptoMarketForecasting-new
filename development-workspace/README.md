## 🔬 Key Research Areas

### Volatility vs Price Prediction
- **Question**: Is volatility more predictable than absolute price?
- **Answer**: Yes! Volatility shows more stable patterns across market conditions
- **Impact**: Led to V2's focus on volatility targets

### Multi-Source Data Integration
- **Question**: How do different data sources affect prediction quality?
- **Answer**: Combining price + derivatives + on-chain + macro significantly improves performance
- **Impact**: V2's comprehensive data collection architecture

### Feature Engineering Optimization
- **Question**: TSFresh vs custom vs hybrid feature approaches?
- **Answer**: Hybrid approach (TSFresh + domain expertise) performs best
- **Impact**: V2's intelligent feature engineering pipeline

### Production Deployment Challenges
- **Question**: What's needed for reliable production deployment?
- **Answer**: Robust error handling, API management, monitoring, configuration
- **Impact**: V2's enterprise-grade architecture

## 📈 Research Insights

### What Worked
✅ **Volatility Targets**: More stable than price targets
✅ **Multiple APIs**: Redundancy improves reliability  
✅ **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Significant performance gains
✅ **Batch API Optimization**: Major cost savings
✅ **Configuration-Driven Design**: Enables rapid experimentation

### What Didn't Work
❌ **Pure Price Prediction**: Too noisy for reliable use
❌ **Single Data Source**: Insufficient signal
❌ **Manual Processes**: Not scalable or reliable
❌ **Default Model Parameters**: Performance left on table
❌ **Hardcoded Settings**: Inflexible for different use cases
